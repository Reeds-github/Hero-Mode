<font size="+2"><b>Setup</b></font>

Before you do anything, make sure you have these things:

1. An UNCHANGED North American (US) Version of "The Thousand-Year Door". This needs to be a clean ISO (MD5 of db9a997a617ee03bbc32336d6945ec02).
2. A Softmodded Wii/Wii U that has Homebrew
3. Get Nintendont or any Gamecube Loader that can load ISOs for the Wii/Wii U

DO ALL of these before you do the upcoming steps
If you have these out of the way, you may proceed 

The mod will not work on any other version of the game.

Now that you have all of the requirements, follow these steps.

<b><font size=+2>Installation for Wii/Wii U:</font></b>

1. Download "Hero Mode Demo v1.rar"
2. Get "xdelta v1.1" and open up "xdeltaUI.exe"
3. For "Patch" you are going to want to find the "Hero Mode.xdelta" file 
4. For "Source File" you want to locate the clean ISO (MD5 of db9a997a617ee03bbc32336d6945ec02)
5. For "Output File" select a folder you will remember and SAVE IT AS "game.iso"
6. Put the "game.iso" in your SD/USB Device. (SD Card\Games\[Name This Folder Whatever]\game.iso)
7. Place the .GCT File that's in the "Hero Mode Demo v1.rar" in (SD Card\Codes\G8ME02.gct)
8. On Nintendont or any GameCube ISO Loader, Make sure Cheats are on! Hero Mode won't work properly otherwise.
