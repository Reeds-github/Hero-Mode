<h2><b>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door: Hero Mode (v3.0) by Reed (Not Released Yet.)</b></font></h2>

<h3><b>About Hero Mode</b></h3>

A reimagined The Thousand-Year Door story with new elements and puzzles that
comes with harder difficulty, badges, and twist! (Two Chapter Demo with the Pit included.)

Hero Mode is intended for "professional players," but can be also played by "casual players" too! 
With that being said, you don't need to superguard at all to beat Hero Mode. 

I am still intending to make "Hero Mode Jr." for those who think It's still too hard.

Lastly; this mod was inspired by "<a href="https://github.com/Brotenko/PMMasterQuest">Paper Mario: Master Quest</a>." I have not fully beaten it myself but from what I've seen and played, you can tell a lot of love went into it. Respect to Master Quest Devs and other Paper Mario mods out there.
