<h3><b>About Hero Mode</b></h3>

A reimagined The Thousand-Year Door story that comes with new puzzles,
harder difficulty, badges, items, and more twists!

Hero Mode is intended for "professional players," but can be also played by "casual players" too! 
You DO NOT need to Superguard to beat Hero Mode. It's more of a strategic overhual on the battle system.

I am still intending to make "Hero Mode Jr." for those who just want to enjoy the ride.

Lastly; this mod was inspired by "<a href="https://github.com/Brotenko/PMMasterQuest">Paper Mario: Master Quest</a>." I have not fully beaten it myself but from what I've seen and played, you can tell a lot of love went into it. Respect to Master Quest Devs and other Paper Mario mods out there.
