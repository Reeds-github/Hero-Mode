<h3><b>About Hero Mode</b></h3>

A reimagined The Thousand-Year Door story that comes with new puzzles,
harder difficulty, badges, items, and more twists!

Hero Mode is intended for "professional players," but can be also played by "casual players" too! 
You DO NOT need to Superguard to beat Hero Mode. It's more of a strategic overhual on the battle system.

I am still intending to make "Hero Mode Jr." for those who just want to enjoy the ride.

Lastly; this mod was inspired by "<a href="https://github.com/Brotenko/PMMasterQuest">Paper Mario: Master Quest</a>." I have not fully beaten it myself but from what I've seen and played, you can tell a lot of love went into it. Respect to Master Quest Devs and other Paper Mario mods out there.

<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

<li>Q: Why does x Version take so long? Any Updates or New Stuff Coming?</li> 
<h1></h1>
A: Typically, modification of this level takes a lot of time to develop. Not only is there text being changed, but textures, items, badges, music, events, and a few other things are altered for Hero Mode. 
Not to mention that when a release is made, there are often bugs, revisions, or changes made to accommodate constructive feedback or genuine errors that could be found in said version. 

Note: Version 4 (Chapter 1+2+Pit) is the final version made public at this time, while the demo is still available, bug fixes may vary while support and focus is being put towards the main build of the project.
<h1></h1> 
<li>Q: How much does the demo change from the original release of Paper Mario: TTYD?</li>
<h1></h1>
A: There are significant changes. Badges, Battle Data, Tattles, Enemies, Combat, Music & Sound Effects. Think of it as an Ocarina of Time: Master Quest, but for TTYD.
<h1></h1>
<li>Q: When will the demo / full game come out?</li>
<h1></h1>
A: It currently will end right when you enter Glitzville. You should still be able to access the Pit of 100 Trials and a few other side content, but nothing more past that..
<h1></h1>
<li>Q: Will there be future updates to the demo?</li>
<h1></h1>
A: No, Chapter 2 will be the final chapter released for a demonstration. All further chapters will be released once the main build has been finalized. 
<h1></h1>
<li>Q: How do I get a US TTYD ISO?</li>
<h1></h1>
A: You will need to own a physical copy of the game and dump them using the application CleanRip.
<h1></h1>  
<li>Q: Can we see any updates or changes to Hero Mode?</li>
<h1></h1>
A: You can! Sometimes Reed will post updates every so often in: https://discord.gg/t8NXUUD 
<h1></h1>
<li>Q: Where can I listen to the Hero Mode OST?</li>
<h1></h1>
A: Right here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFh1UzlzDx-MIGVK-WmsAHCgPP4FUhetP
<h1></h1>
<li>Q: Where can I download the HD Hero Mode Texture Pack?</li>
<h1></h1>
A: Right here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1un29NF5rH4NZL2KoqlsuL_3t8uRvuQ0V/view?usp=sharing
<h1></h1>
<li>Q: My ISO isn’t working with the patcher, what’s wrong?</li>
<h1></h1>
A: Currently, the patcher only supports: .iso, .ciso, .gcz, .nkit, .wia, and .rvz, and works on these platforms: Windows, MAC and Linux.
Any other file format is unsupported or will not work. 

The patcher will also require you to have a US Copy of Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door! You do not need to worry about an md5 checksum as the patcher properly supports revisions or any other changes to your iso. (Unless you're using xdelta, you would need the md5 checksum of db9a997a617ee03bbc32336d6945ec02, US only)
<h1></h1>

<h1>Before anything, you must read this:</h1>

<li>A North American (US) Version of "The Thousand-Year Door" (you'll need correct md5 if you're using xdelta)</b>
<li>This mod will not work on any other version of the game, and no other mod of it. (Sadly.)</li>
<li>A Softmodded Wii/Wii U that has Homebrew with Nintendont. (For Console.)</li>
<li>A GameCube that has Action Replay with Swiss on it. (For Console.)</li>
<li>An updated Development version of the Dolphin Emulator. (For PC.)</li>
<li>.iso, .ciso, .gcz, .nkit, .wia, and .rvz filetypes are compatiable with the Hero Mode Patcher.</li>
