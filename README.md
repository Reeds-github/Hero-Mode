<h3><b>About Hero Mode</b></h3>

A reimagined The Thousand-Year Door story that comes with new puzzles,
harder difficulty, badges, items, and more twists!

Hero Mode is intended for "professional players," but can be also played by "casual players" too! 
You DO NOT need to Superguard to beat Hero Mode. It's more of a strategic overhual on the battle system.

I am still intending to make "Hero Mode Jr." for those who just want to enjoy the ride.

Lastly; this mod was inspired by "<a href="https://github.com/Brotenko/PMMasterQuest">Paper Mario: Master Quest</a>." I have not fully beaten it myself but from what I've seen and played, you can tell a lot of love went into it. Respect to Master Quest Devs and other Paper Mario mods out there.

<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

<li>Q: Why do updates take so long?</li> 
<h1></h1>
A: Typically, modification of this level takes a lot of time to develop. Not only is there text being changed, but textures, items, badges, music, events, and a few other things that are altered for Hero Mode. 
Not to mention that when a release is made, there are often bugs, revisions, or changes made to accommodate constructive feedback or genuine errors that could be found in said version.
<h1></h1>
<li>Q: When will the full version of Hero Mode come out?</li>
<h1></h1>
A: Right now I am working by chapter and will release Hero Mode chapter by chapter.
<h1></h1>
<li>Q: How do I get a US TTYD ISO?</li>
<h1></h1>
A: You will need to own a physical copy of the game and dump them using the application CleanRip.
<h1></h1>  
<li>Q: Where can we see updates or changes to Hero Mode?</li>

A: You can keep track of Hero Mode's progress in <a href="https://discord.gg/t8NXUUD">Reed's Discord</a> or the <a href="https://discord.gg/KctYtmW7zB">Star Haven Discord</a>.
<h1></h1>
<li>Q: My ISO isn’t working with the patcher, what’s wrong?</li>
<h1></h1>
A: Currently, the patcher only supports: .iso, .ciso, .gcz, .nkit, .wia, and .rvz, and works on these platforms: Windows, MAC and Linux.
Any other file format is unsupported or will not work. 

The patcher will also require you to have a US Copy of Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door! You do not need to worry about an md5 checksum as the patcher properly supports revisions or any other changes to your iso. (Unless you're using xdelta, you would need the md5 checksum of db9a997a617ee03bbc32336d6945ec02, US only)

<li>Q: Where can I listen to the Hero Mode OST?</li>
<h1></h1>

<li>Q: Where can I download the HD Texture Pack for Hero Mode?</li>
