<h3><b>About Hero Mode</b></h3>

A reimagined The Thousand-Year Door Story with new elements and puzzles that
comes with a harder difficulty, badges, and twist!

<h1>Before you do anything, make sure you have these things:</h1>

- A North American (US) Version of "The Thousand-Year Door" (md5 of db9a997a617ee03bbc32336d6945ec02)
- A Softmodded Wii/Wii U that has Homebrew.
- Get Nintendont so you can load the ISO for the Wii/Wii U.
- Get Dolphin 5.0-12749 If you wish to play on Emulator (If it asks to update, refuse to update it.)

The mod will not work on any other version of the game.

Now that you have all of the requirements, follow these steps.

<b><h3>Installation for Wii/Wii U:</h3></b>

1. Download "Hero Mode Demo v1.rar"
2. Open up "<b>xdeltaUI.exe</b>"
3. For "Patch" you are going to want to find the "<b>game.xdelta</b>" file.
4. For "Source File" you want to locate the ISO (md5 of db9a997a617ee03bbc32336d6945ec02)
5. For "Output File" select a folder you will remember and <b>SAVE IT AS</b> "<b>game.iso</b>" Don't forget the "<b>.iso</b>" part

Once you press "patch" DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING and wait for a window to pop up saying otherwise.

6. Put the "<b>game.iso</b>" in your SD/USB Device. (SD Card\Games\ [Name This Folder Whatever] \game.iso) 
7. Place the <b>G8ME02.GCT</b> File that's in the "Hero Mode Demo v1.rar" file in (SD Card\Codes\G8ME02.gct) 

<b>DO NOT CHANGE THE NUMBER OF THE GCT!</b>

8. On Nintendont, Make sure <b>CHEATS ARE ON</b>, Hero Mode won't work properly otherwise.
9. You can use any type of Memory Card option, Virtual or Real. Just make sure <b>Cheats are ON</b>.

NINTENDONT HAS A BUG WHERE THE FIRST TIME YOU BOOT UP HERO MODE

IT DOESN'T LOAD THE GCT! SO LOAD HERO MODE, MAKE A SAVE FILE AND RELOAD

HERO MODE THROUGH THE NINTENDONT LOADER!

Load the game and Enjoy :)
